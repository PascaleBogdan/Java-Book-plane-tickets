## Java Book Plane Ticket Application

The Java Book Plane Ticket Application is a fundamental project developed as part of my first semester final assessment. The application serves as a basic reservation system for booking plane tickets, aimed at demonstrating proficiency in Java programming fundamentals and software development concepts.

## Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can register accounts and log in securely to access the booking functionalities.

Flight Booking Interface: The application provides an intuitive interface for users to search for flights based on their preferences, including destination, date, and number of passengers.

Seat Selection and Reservation: Once the desired flight is found, users can select seats and proceed with the reservation process.

Ticket Confirmation and Payment Integration: After seat selection, users receive a confirmation of their booking and can proceed to make payments using integrated payment gateways.

Booking Management: Users can manage their bookings, including viewing details, modifying reservations, and canceling tickets.

## Technologies Used:

Java Programming Language: Core logic and functionality are implemented using Java programming language.
Java Swing: User interface components are designed using Java Swing for a graphical user interface (GUI).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: Concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are applied to ensure clean and modular code architecture.
Data Structures and Algorithms: Data structures and algorithms are employed for efficient data management and processing.
File Handling: File handling operations are utilized for storing user data, flight details, and booking information.

## Learning Outcomes:

Gain practical experience in Java programming and software development methodologies.
Understand the importance of user-friendly interfaces and responsive design principles.
Learn to implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a software application.
Enhance problem-solving and debugging skills through real-world project development.
